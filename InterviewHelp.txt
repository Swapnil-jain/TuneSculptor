About Docker:
1. Every new line is executed sequentially and each line creates a new layer. This helps in caching as if eg. something is changed in line 4, only lines after line 4 are ran again and lines before line 4 are just taken from the cache.
2. A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. Docker image is like a blueprint for the container. 
3. A container is a runnning instance of a Docker image.
4. By tagging a Docker image, it becomes easier for identifcation and management instead of using the long image ID everytime.
5. Container vs Virtual machine: A virtual machine has a OS on it and it virtualises the hardware via something called 'hypervisor'. A container only virtualises the base OS.
6. RUN executes commands during the image build process to modify the image itself. CMD specifies the default command to run when a container is launched from the image.
